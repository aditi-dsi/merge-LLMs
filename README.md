# Merge Large Language Models and Build a Custom LLM with MergeKit
MergeKit, a model merging toolkit, allows developers to merge the strengths of multiple LLMs into a single, optimized model without the need for additional training or ensembling overhead. By working directly in the weight space of models, MergeKit makes it possible to combine specialized models, find trade-offs between models, and even create new capabilities.

# How to Merge Models using MergeKit
For a step-by-step process of merging LLMs by leveraging MergeKit, checkout my guide here: https://nodeshift.com/blog/merge-large-language-models-build-a-custom-llm-with-mergekit.

Its recommended to follow my Python notebook along with the guide for code simulations.
